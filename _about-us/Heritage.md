### HISTORY OF KHENG CHENG SCHOOL SINCE 1927




The schoolâ€™s history can be traced back to 1910 when Madam Lim Peng Tuan arrived and set up home in Shrewsbury Road, a rural area near Newton and Moulmein. In 1922, Madam Lim was approached by a scholar, Mr Tan Cheo Teng to set up a school. She agreed as she saw this to be an excellent opportunity to provide education for the neighbourhood children.
