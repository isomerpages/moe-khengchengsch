#### National Chinese Calligraphy Competition 2024 Winner

On 23 February, 21 of our Kheng Cheng School students participated in the **National Chinese Calligraphy Competition 2024**. This competition aims to cultivate an appreciation of Chinese culture through the art of calligraphy, while promoting the art form itself and celebrating the festive season.

We are thrilled to congratulate Zhang Xinyu from Primary 6.4, who has been named one of the Top 30 Finalists in Category One and awarded a consolation prize! Her beautiful calligraphy translates to:

'Dragons dance over a pond of spring, birds sing in thousands of households at dawn.'

This poetic calligraphy beautifully captures the vibrancy and joy of springtime.

Congratulations to Xinyu and all our Kheng Cheng School participants for their dedication and hard work!

#### **National School Games (NSG)**

The National School Games (NSG) resumed on 19 April for Primary school athletes - the Senior Division (Primary 6) students competed (over a span of two weeks from 19 to 28 April) and the Junior Division (Primary 4 &amp; 5) will take place in July.  
  
KCS sent our athletes to participate in the following relays:

*   1,500m
*   4 X 100m  
    
*   4 X 300m
*   High Jumps &amp; Long Jumps (in both Senior Boys &amp; Girls categories)  
    
We are proud that&nbsp;**KCS clinched Gold for high-jump by Gan Jeng Yu (P6.4) &amp; a commendable 4th position by Tsen Yu Han (Senior Girls Div 1 &amp; 2 respectively)**
    
*   Our Senior Boys, Brayden See (P6.5) &amp; Joachim U (P6.6) garnered 5th positions for the high jump event.
*   Our boys ( Anden Low \[P6.5\], Hadi, Thai An &amp; Loong Qi - came in 5th also for 4 X 300m and 4 X 100m events.  
    
    Overall, all our the athletes did a great job, given the 'short run-way' of preparation &amp; (face-to-face) trainings (of only 5-6 weeks), leading to the NSG in April. More importantly, our KCS athletes' unwavering &amp; 'never-say-die' attitude put into the limited trainings and the actual days of competitions in a stadium setting (at Bukit Gombak), the coaches &amp; teachers provided for them, were highly commendable - and we are all very proud of them!"
