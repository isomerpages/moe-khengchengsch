<img src="/images/Kheng-Cheng-School-Logo.jpg" style="width:20%">


**Blue   :**       Perpetuation of Values
**White :**    Dignity, Purity and Diligence
**Gold   :**      Honesty, Courage and Endurance

The upper part of the crest has a dark blue background with the name of the school in white. This symbolises the commitment of KHENG CHENG SCHOOL to Singaporeâ€™s educational policy. The typeface is indicative of a school that is forward looking.

The lower part of the crest uses dark blue for the two ancient chinese characters for KHENG CHENG. This is symbolic of our endeavour to perpetuate traditional Asian values.

The white letters in English and the white trim on the chinese characters symbolise our commitment to uphold bilingualism. The gold border symbolise cohesiveness and cooperation.
