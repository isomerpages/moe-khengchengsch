<p><strong>Blue&nbsp; &nbsp;:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perpetuation
of Values
<br><strong>White :</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dignity, Purity and Diligence
<br><strong>Gold&nbsp; &nbsp;:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Honesty,
Courage and Endurance</p>
<p>The upper part of the crest has a dark blue background with the name of
the school in white. This symbolises the commitment of KHENG CHENG SCHOOL
to Singaporeâ€™s educational policy. The typeface is indicative of a school
that is forward looking.</p>
<p>The lower part of the crest uses dark blue for the two ancient chinese
characters for KHENG CHENG. This is symbolic of our endeavour to perpetuate
traditional Asian values.</p>
<p>The white letters in English and the white trim on the chinese characters
symbolise our commitment to uphold bilingualism. The gold border symbolise
cohesiveness and cooperation.</p>
