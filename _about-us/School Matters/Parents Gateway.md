<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Parents Gateway is a new digital platform developed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to parents to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schoolsâ€™ programmes and activities.<br><br>
This enables parents to better support their child in their education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools. Kheng Cheng School will start using Parents Gateway in Term 2 2019. We invite parents to download the Parents Gateway mobile application today.
