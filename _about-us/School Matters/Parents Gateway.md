# Parents Gateway

Parents Gateway is a new digital platform developed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to parents to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes and activities.

This enables parents to better support their child in their education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools. Kheng Cheng School will start using Parents Gateway in Term 2 2019. We invite parents to download the **Parents Gateway mobile application** today.
