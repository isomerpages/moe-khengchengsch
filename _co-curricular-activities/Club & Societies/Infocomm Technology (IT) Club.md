The IT Club aims to cultivate interest and awareness in the use of Information Technology, such as coding and photography in our students. Members of the club will be imparted with basic Information Technology knowledge on coding and photography skills. Members are able to transfer their learning as they embark on the hands-on experiences in creating apps and taking photographs. The club also provides a platform for the members to employ creativity and adopt alternative perspectives as they make progress in their learning. 

In the recent years, the club has taken part in various inter-school competitions for greater exposure and learning for its members. These enriching experiential learning opportunities will continue to sustain the interest in students’ learning as they progress beyond the classrooms.
