<p><strong>Our Aspiration</strong>
</p>
<p>We aspire to nurture students who perform with confidence, listen with
sensitivity, and collaborate with compassion. Through music, we seek to
develop not only technical skills, but also discipline, empathy, and a
sense of purpose. By positioning music as both a creative discipline and
a shared human experience, we empower students to connect meaningfully
with their school community, cultural heritage, and the wider world.</p>
