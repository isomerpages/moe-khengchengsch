<p><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>Sexuality Education</strong> (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>The Goals of Sexuality Education are:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that
are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>The Key Messages of Sexuality Education are:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and

ones.</p>

<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty.
With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty
at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological
changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming
biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having
the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours.
Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that
could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students
require close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the
sexual messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part
of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will
learn healthy ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes
in their growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>At Kheng Cheng School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2024</u>:</strong>
