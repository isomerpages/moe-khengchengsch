# 	Key Programmes
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;;color:black"><b><u>Character & Citizenship Education</span></b></u>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"> The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be exemplary individuals and useful citizens.  
CCE lessons in KCS are aligned to the components of MOE: <br><br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<b>CCE(MTL)</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
 CCE lessons in KCS are taught in Mother Tongue Languages. Lessons include the teaching of values, knowledge and skills for CCE.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<b>School-based CCE</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
This is done through explicit teaching of the KCS core values of Kindness in Heart, Courage to Stand, Sincerity of Might and Diligence of Hand. Student Voice and advocacy and Project Work (VIA) are also embedded in the School-based CCE curriculum.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<b>CCE(FTGP)</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) provides time within the curriculum for form teachers to engage in quality interactions with their students and for them to strengthen their social and emotional competencies. Skills learnt during FTGP lessons include recognizing and managing emotions, developing care and concern for others, establishing positive relationships, making responsible decisions, and handling challenging situations constructively and ethically.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<b>Form Teacher Interaction(FTI)</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
FTI provides support for improving the quality of teacher-student interactions and, ultimately, student learning. Teachers help students develop warm, supportive relationships, foster the joy of learning, feel comfortable in class, and experience appropriate levels of autonomy or independence.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<b>The Growing Years (GY) Programme</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. Students at this age grapple with physical, emotional, and psychological changes in themselves. The Primary 5 & 6 Growing Years package, ‘Curious Minds’, aims to meet students’ developmental needs, emphasise the teaching of skills and values, and focus on helping students navigate changes, build healthy relationships, especially online relationships and cyber wellness.

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
<b>ECG Programme</b>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>
At KCS, the Educate. Cultivate. Guide (ECG) programme focuses on developing and grooming our students to succeed in the 21st century. ECG@KCS is a school-wide programme. All KCS students will complete an ECG module each semester during school-based CCE lessons. This is to prepare our students for a future of uncertainty. The lessons bring about awareness of new and emerging occupations and the skills and dispositions they need to be equipped with.<br><br>
The key components for our approach are:  
<b>Educate:</b>  Learn about the wide array of occupations in Singapore.  
	<b>Cultivate:</b> Identify and cultivate personal characteristics such as interests, skills/aptitudes and values, and  
	<b>Guide:</b> Be guided in understanding the different skills set required in the field of work.

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<b>RMU/VIP</b><br>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
“Raise Me Up” (RMU) and “Very Inspiring Pupils” (VIP) is a school-wide character development programme. Both RMU and VIP are channels for students (RMU) and teachers (VIP) to nominate students who exemplify good values each term.

RMU and VIP provide students with the understanding to do the right thing (Head), work on building the will to want to act right (Heart) and cultivate the habit to do so (Hands). It fosters an environment that promotes active involvement by all students to be well behaved.<br><br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Student Voice & Advocacy(SVA)@KCS</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
The distinctive programme in Kheng Cheng School is its Learning for Life Programme; Student Voice and Advocacy @ KCS. In SVA@ KCS, students act as advocates and agents of change. They design and implement community service activities to give back to the community (school, external agencies) as they think beyond themselves. Some of the key features of SVA@KCS include:

<b>1) Progressive student outcomes.</b>

The school identifies the stages of the student voice continuum to be taught in various levels (lower, middle and upper primary) in a cumulative approach, beginning from ‘decoration’ stage at Primary 1, to a completely student led stage at Primary 6 where they are expected to plan, negotiate and implement a VIA class activity for the community together.

<b>2) Learning experiences are differentiated across the levels.</b>

SVA Themes are aligned to the MOE CCE syllabus and students work on projects they want to do.

<b>3) Student Voice is valued & issues pertaining active citizenry are explored.</b>

Teachers use Student Voice to imbue in the students their larger social role as advocates and agents of change, in the design and implementation of a grounds up community service project in VIA, so as to strengthen the Singapore spirit of an active citizen in them.

<b>4) Teachers act as facilitators in SVA.</b>

As facilitators, teachers ensure the students are aware of the goals of SVA@KCS. We consciously involve students in adapting goals and we try to link the content to the world beyond their classroom.
<br>

<b>There are two aspects of SVA@KCS – school improvement and community service.</b>
<img src = "/images/CCE/CCE/sva.png" style="width:100%">

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>SVA@KCS - School Improvement Consists of:</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">    
School wide programmes put in place through the year:<br>
<ul>
	<li>To empower students with a voice to step forward to become active agents of change; and</li>
	<li>To practise advocacy and active citizenry in their immediate community.</li>
	</ul>
	<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"> The infusion of student voice into school activities allow for cross fertilisation of ideas beyond the class and age groups thus enriching the learning experiences of all. <br>

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>SVA@KCS - Community Service</b>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">      
It is essentially a tiered programme offered to all students from Primary 1 to Primary 6. Students are purposefully guided in using Visible Thinking routines \[from the Harvard Ground Zero Project,\] to plan a social service project targeted at the serving the community. Students learn to make thoughtful decisions and exercise reasoned judgement as the Visible Thinking routines provide the cognitive task support and scaffold needed. A grounds-up approach, all Kheng Cheng School’s students would have done their part to strengthen the Singapore Spirit to support a recipient of their choice as part of service to their community by year end. Because we allow the students to have to say, each class would be doing something unique and close to their hearts.

The impact of SVA@KCS can be seen in the manner in which the LLP was carried out in the different classes.

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Joy of Learning</b>	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students are motivated intrinsically to develop their passions and strengths as they explore the landscape around them and work on a project to serve the community.
	
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Develop the Entrepreneurial Dare</b>	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students apply skills learnt in class to the real world as they delve in their passions to serve the community based on an issue close to their hearts. Students realise that not all projects might be a resounding success but they have in them the resilience to try and learn from failure as they do it another time.

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Strengthen the Singapore Spirit</b>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><br>Active citizenry is well and alive in SVA@KCS. Students are committed to action in building and deepening the Singapore spirit as they serve the community beyond what they do in the classroom.
