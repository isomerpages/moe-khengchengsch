<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Empowering teachers to integrate technology and students to thrive in
tech-rich learning in an evolving digital world.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Students Outcomes:</strong>
</p>
<p>"Our goal is to cultivate tech-savvy and responsible digital citizens
who are equipped with the competencies to thrive, collaborate, and contribute
meaningfully to the digital age."</p>
<p><strong><u>ICT Literacy Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Kheng Cheng School, our ICT literacy programme is purposefully designed
to transform students into <strong>digitally-empowered learners and future-ready innovators</strong>.
By focusing on <strong>Digital Literacy and Technological Skills (DLTS)</strong>,
we provide our students with the confidence and competence to use technology
as a powerful catalyst for learning, creating, and real-world problem-solving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add the following as programmes in KCS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Master the Keys: Our School-Wide Touch-Typing Programme</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Kheng Cheng School, we believe that digital fluency starts with the
basics. To ensure our students can express their ideas as fast as they
can think of them, we have integrated a structured <strong>Touch Typing Programme</strong> for
all levels, from Primary 1 to Primary 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Touch Typing Matters:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive Focus:</strong> By mastering "blind typing," students
shift their mental energy from finding keys to focusing on the quality
of their writing and creative problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Efficiency:</strong> As students progress to upper primary,
the ability to type accurately and quickly is essential for completing
digital assignments, e-exams, and research projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health and Ergonomics:</strong> Learning the correct finger placement
early promotes better posture and reduces physical strain during long periods
of computer use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Future Readiness:</strong> Proficiency in typing is a life skill
that serves as a bridge to secondary school, higher education, and the
modern workplace.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>KCS Cyber Wellness conducts classroom activities, ambassadors development
programmes and assembly talks for students. Utilising efficient pedagogical
approaches is crucial for shaping the design of all programmes. Incorporating
various learning styles of students, certain strategies are implemented
in the programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Align with the MOE’s direction, our program is guided by the framework
to implement a holistic CW education.</p>
<p>It involves the <strong>Sense-Think-Act</strong> process, explained as follows:</p>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p><strong>Sense</strong>: Identify the possible risks of harmful behaviors
online and learn how to protect oneself.</p>
<p><strong>Think</strong>: Analyse, evaluate and reflect on the online situation
based on the three Cyber Wellness principles.</p>
<p><strong>Act</strong>: Translate understanding into actions to be safe
and have a positive presence online.</p>

<p>The three major anchors to KCS CW education are the assembly talks, CCE
lessons and CW Week which are conducted by the CW team, CW ambassadors
and teachers.&nbsp; In addition, the school also uses awareness posters
and ad-hoc awareness messages posted on the school website or educational
platform (e.g. SLS).</p>
<p>Empowering Peers for the Digital Age Our Cyberwellness Ambassadors are
the heartbeat of our online safety initiatives. By taking the lead in promoting
positive digital footprints and smart online choices, these trained Kheng
Chengian leaders help their peers navigate the complexities of the internet.
Their mission is simple: to ensure that as we innovate and learn online,
we do so with responsibility, kindness, and a watchful eye for our fellow
students.&nbsp;</p>
