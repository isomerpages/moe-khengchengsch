The STELLAR Vision

Children Who Love Reading And have a Strong Foundation In the English Language

STELLAR aims to strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational years. The programme uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage children in the learning of English.  
Teachers are empowered to teach our children the critical life skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing in English through effective and engaging strategies that are developmentally appropriate.

The teaching approaches and resources are designed to deliver the outcomes of English Language Syllabus 2010 / English Language Syllabus 2010 (Foundation).

The STELLAR pedagogic model for lower primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

*   Shared Book Approach (SBA)
*   Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)
*   Learning Centres (LC)

Our KCS Library
---------------

The re-conceptualization of the School Library started way back as KCS embarked on the PERI upgrading programme. After years of anticipation, the vision that was set in 2017 finally became a reality on 19 April. Students and staff had been looking forward to the day where once again the allurement of books, the stories and characters within, flood our imagination and take us on odysseys and adventures.

Key Programmes
--------------

**English Language Fiesta @ KCS**

**Languages Fiesta 2022**

![Lang Fiesta 1](https://khengcheng.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lang-Fiesta-1-300x167.png)

To immerse students in the use of languages, the English Department organised various activities to aoruse students’ interest in the English Language through reading, listening, speaking and writing. During the two weeks, students challenged one another to see who could recite the given tongue twisters the fastest. They also took part in spelling bees to see how many words they could spell accurately. Primary 1 and 2 students were also encouraged to come dressed in their favourite story book characters. Students had a fun time sharing about their favourite characters and stories. Pre-assembly activities were organised to promote the use of good spoken and written English. Our P3s and P4s tried their hands at poetry writing too. They let their creative juices flow and enjoyed the chance to share their drawings with others. It was a joy seeing students immersed in the use of English Language. As they say, with languages, you are at home anywhere!

**Pre-assembly Storytelling Focusing on Values**

Teachers in the English Language Department conduct storytelling sessions on Monday mornings before assembly. The aim is to enthuse students in stories and imbue them with the values as portrayed in each story. Since 2014, more students are trained by their English Language teachers to assume the task of storytelling to their peers in the mornings.

**Drama-in-writing Programmes**
The EL teachers conduct drama-in-writing sessions for their students in Primary 1 and 2. This is an interactive approach which boosts the fun element in learning to write, engages the students with whole-class participation and improves students’ confidence. Students engage in simple dramatization to enable them to immerse themselves in the story they will be writing. They feel and verbalise the actions and feelings of the different characters through process drama techniques.

**NOVEL Programmes**
The middle primary NOVEL programme aims to encourage a greater love for reading books beyond the Stellar curriculum. **N**arratives **O**f **V**ery **E**xciting **L**essons take place as students read extensively and view digital media through SLS lessons as well as engage in fun post-reading activities in class. Analysing linguistic features and popular storybook characters give our students an early introduction to the literary world of fiction and non-fiction books.

**Primary 1 & 2 Learning Support Programmes, Primary 3 & 4 Reading Remediation Programmes and Buddy Reading Programme**
These programmes provide additional support for our students who are weak in their basic literacy and reading skills. The content and instructional methods are catered to these students and helmed by teachers who are specially trained to conduct these specialised programmes. Due to their small class sizes, the students receive more attention and help from their teachers, enabling them to learn better, boosting their confidence in the process. Some of the activities which the Primary 1 & 2 students in the programme are engaged in include daily pre-assembly reading programmes.

**EL Publication, "SPIN-A-YARN"**
**School Publication, ‘SPIN-A-YARN’ (10th anniversary)**

This school publication consists of three volumes of EL and CL literary works written by our budding writers each year. Each publication also includes an art gallery showcasing the artistic pieces painted and crafted by our little artists. The works featured serve as good models for the students in the school to enjoy and emulate.

**Moo-O**
To motivate children at the P1-4 levels to read fluently and expressively, the school engages the students in using the fun digital courseware, Moo-O. This collaborative platform allows the readers to be immersed in the story that they are reading, transforming them into the story characters via their webcams and microphones. The new Spell function of Moo-O enables students to build their repertoire of vocabulary while learning how to spell these words.

**Creative Writing Programme (CWP)**
Primary 5 students who show interest and aptitude in creative writing are selected to submit a portfolio of their writing to apply for a Creative Writing Programme conducted by MOE. This programme aims to help our budding writers hone their writing skills and nurture their love for the language. Selected students participate in a 3 day non-residential camp where they get to learn writing techniques taught by published writers. Students may also get an opportunity to showcase their writing in _Mementoes_, a compilation of poetry and prose shared during the course.
