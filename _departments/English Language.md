The STELLAR Vision

Children Who Love Reading And have a Strong Foundation In the English Language

STELLAR aims to strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning in the foundational years. The programme uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to engage children in the learning of English.  
Teachers are empowered to teach our children the critical life skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing in English through effective and engaging strategies that are developmentally appropriate.

The teaching approaches and resources are designed to deliver the outcomes of English Language Syllabus 2010 / English Language Syllabus 2010 (Foundation).

The STELLAR pedagogic model for lower primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

*   Shared Book Approach (SBA)
*   Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)
*   Learning Centres (LC)

Our KCS Library
---------------

The re-conceptualization of the School Library started way back as KCS embarked on the PERI upgrading programme. After years of anticipation, the vision that was set in 2017 finally became a reality on 19 April. Students and staff had been looking forward to the day where once again the allurement of books, the stories and characters within, flood our imagination and take us on odysseys and adventures.

Key Programmes

**English Language Fiesta @ KCS**

**Languages Fiesta 2022**

![Lang Fiesta 1](https://khengcheng.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lang-Fiesta-1-300x167.png)

To immerse students in the use of languages, the English Department organised various activities to aoruse students’ interest in the English Language through reading, listening, speaking and writing. During the two weeks, students challenged one another to see who could recite the given tongue twisters the fastest. They also took part in spelling bees to see how many words they could spell accurately. Primary 1 and 2 students were also encouraged to come dressed in their favourite story book characters. Students had a fun time sharing about their favourite characters and stories. Pre-assembly activities were organised to promote the use of good spoken and written English. Our P3s and P4s tried their hands at poetry writing too. They let their creative juices flow and enjoyed the chance to share their drawings with others. It was a joy seeing students immersed in the use of English Language. As they say, with languages, you are at home anywhere!

**Pre-assembly Storytelling Focusing on Values**

Teachers in the English Language Department conduct storytelling sessions on Monday mornings before assembly. The aim is to enthuse students in stories and imbue them with the values as portrayed in each story. Since 2014, more students are trained by their English Language teachers to assume the task of storytelling to their peers in the mornings.
