#### 1.	Languages Fiesta @ KCS

To immerse students in the use of languages, the English Department organises various activities to arouse students’ interest in the English Language through reading, listening, speaking and writing for Languages Fiesta.

Last year, students challenged one another to see who could recite the given tongue twisters the fastest. They also took part in spelling bees to see how many words they could spell accurately. Primary 1 and 2 students were also encouraged to come dressed in their favourite story book characters. Students had a fun time sharing about their favourite characters and stories. Pre-assembly activities were organised to promote the use of good spoken and written English. Our P3s and P4s tried their hands at poetry writing too. They let their creative juices flow and enjoyed the chance to share their drawings with others. It was a joy seeing students immersed in the use of English Language. As they say, with languages, you are at home anywhere!


#### 2.	Drama-in-writing Programme

The EL teachers conduct drama-in-writing sessions for their students in Primary 1 and 2. This is an interactive approach which boosts the fun element in learning to write, engages the students with whole-class participation and improves students’ confidence. Students engage in simple dramatization to enable them to immerse themselves in the story they will be writing. They feel and verbalise the actions and feelings of the different characters through process drama techniques.

#### 3.	NOVEL Programme

The middle primary NOVEL programme aims to encourage a greater love for reading books beyond the Stellar curriculum. Narratives Of Very Exciting Lessons take place as students read extensively and view digital media through SLS lessons as well as engage in fun post-reading activities in class. Analysing linguistic features and popular storybook characters give our students an early introduction to the literary world of fiction and non-fiction books.

#### 4.	P1 and P2 Learning Support Programmes, P3 and P4 Reading Remediation Programmes and Buddy Reading Programme

These programmes provide additional support for our students who are weak in their basic literacy and reading skills. The content and instructional methods are catered to these students and helmed by teachers who are specially trained to conduct these specialised programmes. Due to their small class sizes, the students receive more attention and help from their teachers, enabling them to learn better, boosting their confidence in the process. Some of the activities which the Primary 1 &amp; 2 students in the programme are engaged in include daily pre-assembly reading programmes.

#### 5.	School Publication, ‘Spin-A-Yarn’

This school publication consists of three volumes of EL and MT literary works written by our budding writers each year. Each publication also includes an art gallery showcasing the artistic pieces painted and crafted by our little artists. The works featured serve as good models for the students in the school to enjoy and emulate.


#### 6.	Moo-O and NewsMaker

To motivate our P1 to P3 children to read fluently and expressively, the school engages the students in using the fun digital courseware, Moo-O. This collaborative platform allows the readers to be immersed in the story that they are reading, transforming them into the story characters. As part of cultivating a love for the language through innovative and engaging broadcasting technologies, our P4 and P5 students create content using NewsMaker for a variety of purposes.

#### 7.	Creative Writing Programme

Primary 5 students who show interest and aptitude in creative writing are selected to submit a portfolio of their writing to apply for a Creative Writing Programme conducted by MOE. This programme aims to help our budding writers hone their writing skills and nurture their love for the language. Selected students participate in a 3 day non-residential camp where they get to learn writing techniques taught by published writers. Students may also get an opportunity to showcase their writing in Mementoes, a compilation of poetry and prose shared during the course.

#### 8.	Tinkerspace

 Tinkerspace is where students engage in hands-on activities in Science, Technology, Arts and Maths (S.T.E.A.M). We want our students to put on their tinkering hats and let their imagination run wild.
