# CyberWellness
Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. Guided by the MOE’s Cyber Wellness framework’s principles of ‘Respect for Self and Others’ and ‘Safe and Responsible Use’, the Cyber Wellness curriculum and programmes in our school are planned and implemented to equip students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful, discerning and responsible ICT users.

Cyber Wellness lessons are delivered via Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum. Key Cyber Wellness topics are also incorporated into Baseline ICT Standard lessons, MOE Sexuality Education, Growing Year package and subjects such as English and Mother Tongue Languages where appropriate.

# CyberWellness Week

Cyber Wellness week is also being organised annually by the CW Ambassadors and teachers to heighten awareness and spread Cyber Wellness messages. These messages are promoted through the use of videos, quizzes, posters and hands-on activities. This event is organised with the support of our PSG.
