# Mission

# Objective
Our school harnesses the use of ICT to nurture our students in becoming self-directed and collaborative learners of the 21st century. With the resources and support provided, we hope to encourage students to become self-directed learners.

To bring about a shift in ICT practices for learning and teaching, a sustained school-wide effort is required. Instructional leadership is at all levels. The direction of the school is to ensure quality teaching and learning with ICT and create an ICT learning environment to support effective implementation of teaching and learning with technology.

# Approach

1. To engage students and create responsibility for their own learning.

2. To train students to build knowledge collaboratively and solve real world problems creatively.

3. To develop lifelong passion for learning with the help of ICT.

In the event of a school closure due to unforeseen circumstances, student learning will be facilitated through home-based learning. The school also conducts home-based learning during school holidays and during PSLE marking exercise.
