# Vision
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Every KCS student an informed and an active citizen in solving current and future issues on sustainability. 

# Mission
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Enable every child to develop interest in issues involving sustainability, question unsustainable practices, possess sufficient knowledge to engage in discussion on related issues and eventually become advocates and agents for more sustainable living.

# Objectives
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>To develop students who are global citizens.
	<li>To engage students in understanding some global challenges, motivating them to realise they can make a difference.
 <li>To develop awareness in sustainable living through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
 <li>To develop 21st century competencies of critical and inventive thinking, collaboration, communication and information skills.

# Approach
<img src = "/images/ALP/alp.png" style="width:100%"><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The programme uses a two-prong approach to achieve its outcomes of developing thinking skills and values in students.  At the first tier, all students will be involved in studying an issue involving one of United Nations Sustained Development Goals (SDGs) through a problem-based approach. Students will also be using coding to code a solution to the problem or a representation of the problem. At tier 2, selected P5 students will explore the SDGs further and to learn more advance coding.
