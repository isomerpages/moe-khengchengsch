<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A community of engaged, discerning and empathetic citizens who interact
thoughtfully with issues impacting their communities and beyond.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>National Education is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions,
which enable our students to realise their part in the flourishing of their
community and nation: a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense
of hope, and the will to act. These dispositions, together with knowledge,
skills and values gained from Social Studies, will help students become
citizens who are informed, concerned and participative</p>
<p>To provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understanding Singapore’s history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate our journey to nationhood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have confidence in our nation’s future</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Social Studies Approach</h3>
<h5>Philosophy of Social Studies</h5>
<p>Social Studies curriculum, through the inquiry approach, seeks to inculcate
in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore
society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for
the society and the world in which they live and demonstrate empathy in
their relationships with others.</p>

<h5>Objectives Syllabus Design</h5>
<p>The syllabus is designed using a thematic approach, structured along the
key themes1 of Identity, Culture and Heritage and People and Environment,
is adopted to frame the Social Studies Primary (SSP) syllabus. It is organised
into three broad clusters:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cluster 1: Discovering Self and Immediate Environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster 2: Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster 3: Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live In.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Programmes: Social Studies in KCS</h3>
<p>In line with the schools’ mission and vision, we hope that students will
be able to be informed, concerned and participative citizens. We aim to
provide the students with the relevant experiences in and beyond school
over their 6 years of their primary school education. Below is an overview
of the programmes and activities put in place for the students:</p>

<h3>Key Programmes: National Education Commemorative Events</h3>
<h5>Total Defence Day</h5>
<p>Together We Keep Singapore Strong. This year marks 40 years of Total Defence
(TD40) in Singapore. As part of our commemoration of TD40 this year, our
students experienced an energy disruption simulation in school on <strong>Friday, 16 February 2024.</strong> Electricity
was turned off school-wide for at least an hour. Despite not having electricity
for an hour, students and teachers remained resilient and adaptable. Students
even folded paper fans to keep themselves cool when the fans were switched
off. Students were engaged in activities during the week and learnt more
on the various pillars of Total Defence and how to react during a crisis.
During the assembly, our students and teachers from the Uniformed Groups
led in the flag raising ceremony. The skit that was put up during assembly
was interactive. Through the enriching experience, students learnt to be
prepared and not to panic during a crisis. Together a Stronger Singapore,
indeed!</p>
