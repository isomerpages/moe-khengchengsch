### Vision

A critical thinker who is an informed, concerned and participative citizen. 

### Objectives

National Education is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which enable our students to realise their part in the flourishing of their community and nation: a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope, and the will to act. These dispositions, together with knowledge, skills and values gained from Social Studies, will help students become citizens who are informed, concerned and participative

To provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to: 

* Understanding Singapore’s history
* Appreciate our journey to nationhood
* Cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation 
* Have confidence in our nation’s future

### Social Studies Approach

##### Philosophy of Social Studies

Social Studies curriculum, through the inquiry approach, seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.
