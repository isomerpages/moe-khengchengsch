# Vision
A dynamic community of learners inspired by Science, that inquire like scientists and innovate using Science, for life and society.

# Mission
Empowering every child to be future-ready through the Practices of Science and the Values, Ethics and Attitudes in Science.

# Objectives
* Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives.
* Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

# Approach
Students are given the opportunity to excel and enjoy learning Science through multi-faceted activities at different levels to infuse the spirit of scientific inquiry. The active learning process in Science Education takes place within and beyond the confines of the classrooms and textbooks. These platforms aim to captures students’ interests to be inspired Science learners. Students engage in inquiry-based learning using the 5E-Inquiry model (5E-Inquiry model), which has scientific inquiry at its core, to facilitate the construction and consolidation of Science concepts. Ultimately, students will be able to innovate and propose models and solutions for real world problems.

# Key Programmes
**Young Explorers @ the Zoo! (YEZ!)**

YEZ! takes our students out of the classroom and into the Singapore Zoo. This outdoor learning experience gives our students the opportunity to observe animals and plants at close range to find out more about them. In addition, students will hone their collaborative skills as they work with their friends to complete a series of questions in a trail using hand-held tablets. Do look out for our students holding these devices at the Singapore Zoo!

**Visual Reasoning in Science (VRS)**
“Not all will become a scientist, but a scientist can come from anyone.”

This is the belief that drives VRS. VRS makes use of concept cartoons to help students improve their Science process skills and Science content, and challenge them to think critically. Studies have shown that children are able to build relations between knowledge and observations better when they can imagine themselves as the characters of a show. As such, VRS aims to help our students achieve their potential in Science through challenging yet accessible concept cartoons.
