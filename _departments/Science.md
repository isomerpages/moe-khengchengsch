<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>An innovative community of learners who embody curiosity and creativity
through the application of scientific knowledge.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Empowering every child to be future-ready through the Practices of Science
and the Values, Ethics and Attitudes in Science.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that
they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in
their daily lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue
STEM for future learning and work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to excel and enjoy learning Science
through multi-faceted activities at different levels to infuse the spirit
of scientific inquiry. The active learning process in Science Education
takes place within and beyond the confines of the classrooms and textbooks.
These platforms aim to captures students’ interests to be inspired Science
learners. Students engage in inquiry-based learning using the 5E Inquiry
model (5E Inquiry model), which has scientific inquiry at its core, to
facilitate the construction and consolidation of Science concepts. Ultimately,
students will be able to innovate and propose models and solutions for
real world problems.</p>

<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Young Explorers @ the Zoo! (YEZ!)</strong>
</p>
<p>YEZ! takes our students out of the classroom and into the Singapore Zoo.
This outdoor learning experience gives our students the opportunity to
observe animals and plants at close range to find out more about them.
In addition, students will hone their collaborative skills as they work
with their friends to complete a series of questions in a trail using hand-held
tablets. Do look out for our students holding these devices at the Singapore
Zoo!</p>

<p><strong>Learning Festival</strong>
</p>
<p>A yearly affair, the fiesta continues to be the top favourite and highlight
of every student. Birth from the voices of the students followed by the
DiSciVery fair, this fiesta provides students with the hands-on opportunity
to observe, experience and immerse in the world of Science and Mathematics.</p>

<p>At Kheng Cheng School, we believe that the best learning happens when
students are having fun. The <strong>Sony Creative Science Award (SCSA)</strong> invites
our students to step outside the classroom and into the shoes of an inventor.
By creating toys that showcase scientific concepts, our students develop
a deep, practical understanding of the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>Our Track Record of Success:</strong> We are incredibly proud of
our students' recent accomplishments, having emerged as the <strong>National Champion in 2024</strong> and
continuing our streak as a <strong>Finalist in 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Through SCSA, Kheng Cheng students gain access to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Hands-on Workshops:</strong> Developing technical and "maker" skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative Problem Solving:</strong> Turning abstract theories into
working toys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Skills:</strong> Learning how to present and explain
their inventions.</p>
</li>
