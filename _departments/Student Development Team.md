<p><strong>3. Social Skills</strong>
<br>Students are explicitly taught social skills during CCE lessons. We believe
that by equipping students with social skills, they will be able to build
healthy relationships and make responsible decisions. This will in turns
helps students to build resilience, achieve better mental well-being, which
leads to positive effects on their learning and overall holistic development.</p>
<p><strong>4. Oasis@KCS</strong>
<br>This is our in-house after school programme for selected P5 and P6 students.
At Oasis@KCS, students are given academic support, equipped with life skills
and given opportunities to explore new areas of interest.</p>
