<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Empowering every child to make a difference in their community. A community
of compassionate leaders who lead by example,&nbsp; demonstrating the school
values.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Developing self-disciplined students and compassionate leaders who are
equipped with skills and guided by values to bring forth changes and improvement
within self and others..</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Discipline - To adopt a whole school approach for Restorative Discipline.
<br>Student Leadership – To provide opportunities for student leaders to apply
their learned skills.</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p><strong>Restorative School Discipine</strong>
<br>Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time,
they also need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and
improve. Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instill
self-discipline and good character in students. In school, we adopt a positive
and proactive approach in discipline when we work with our students.</p>
<p>In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline, the school
strives to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, and prevent
challenging behaviours from occurring;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address inappropriate behaviour promptly, and correct it before it affects
students’ development and well-being;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and
restore relationships with others hurt by their actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restorative Practices and mutual respect are the foundations for interactions
across members of the KCS community, not solely through fear and punishment.
Besides educating students to make the right choices, it is important to
restore strained relationships between students and the affected parties.
The aim of Restorative Practice is to manage conflict and tension by repairing
harm and strengthening relationships as a way of building community. It
allows students to reflect on their poor choices made and discover ways
they can do better. Some restorative questions we go through with the students
are:</p>
<p>Restorative Questions for Recall, Reflection and Response:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What happen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was going through your mind at that time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who has been affected by what you did? How?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think about it now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can you do to fix things up?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can I do to help you?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Disciplinary consequences serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor
choices made. It is not punishment, and will be meted out fairly, firmly
and appropriately. Our school establishes rules and regulations for promoting
good behaviour and ensuring a safe and conducive environment for the overall
development of students. Parents / Guardians can refer to the Student Handbook
for our set of school rules and regulations. The school maintains regular
communication between parents and teachers as we believe that strong home-school
partnership is essential in developing self-discipline and good character
in our students.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Discipline Talks</strong>
<br>Discipline talks are conducted on a termly basis. Students are reminded
of the school rules in a timely manner and are advised to abide by them.
Form teachers go through the school rules on the first day of school and
through teachable moments in class.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Talks</strong>
<br><u>Road Safety Programme and Reminders</u>
<br>Students are advised to practise the Kerb Drill when they cross the roads.
Videos are screened to provide visuals for students to better understand
how they can keep themselves safe on the oroads. The P5 students will be
attending road safety training organized by the Traffic Police this year.
The objective of the training is to educate the students on good road safety
habits in a simulated traffic environment and prepare every student to
be conscious of road safety and to shape the right behaviour. Parents will
be informed of the details nearer to the dates.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Play Messages</strong>
<br>The school designates play areas for students to use during their recesses
and lunch breaks. This is to ensure appropriate and sufficient space for
students to play safely. All students are encouraged to leave their classrooms
and take a break on level one during these breaks. Reminders on safe and
responsible play are sent through morning announcements. We encourage students
to share playing spaces and be alert to their surroundings. Students should
not engage in rough play and should not play if he/she is not well. If
students notice injury, they are to report to a nearby teacher on duty.
Some areas students should not play at are the corridors, at the staircases
and in the canteen. Through level meetings with the assistant year heads
and year heads, students are also reminded on how to play safely.</p>
<p>A simple slogan for our students to remember:</p>
<p>Safety is as simple as ABC. <strong>A</strong>lways <strong>B</strong>e <strong>C</strong>areful!</p>

<p><strong>Promoting Punctuality</strong>
<br>School hours start at 7.30 a.m. and we strongly encourage students to
come early. Punctuality is a crucial life skill we want to imbue in our
students. Parents would be informed of students’ late-coming through daily
late-coming slips issued to students. For recalcitrant students, a Parent-Teacher
Conference would be arranged for teachers to understand more and share
strategies that the student can try out in order to be punctual. Our teachers
take the students’ daily attendance, and late-coming will be noted as part
of a student’s behavioural record.</p>
<p><strong>Counselling</strong>
<br><strong><em>What is Counselling?</em></strong>
<br>Counselling provides an opportunity for children to talk, in confidence,
about things that are worrying them or affecting their day to day life.
What children choose to talk about is completely up to them, but common
issues are bullying, parental separation, stress, friendships, change,
bereavement, distressing traumatic events and anger.</p>
<p><strong><em>What does the school counsellor do?</em></strong>
<br>Counsellors are trained to listen without judging and to help children
sort out their thoughts and feelings. Counsellors in primary schools often
use creative activities such as drawing, art and writing to help a child
express their concerns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why have a counsellor in school?</em></strong>
<br>When children are experiencing difficulties at home or in school their
concentration and the way they behave can be adversely effected. The school
counsellor provides counselling to children in a place that is familiar,
safe and secure. By providing emotional support and enabling children to
‘off load’ feelings and anxieties counselling can help a child to concentrate
more in class, feel better about themselves and build their self-confidence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where and when does counselling take place?</em></strong>
<br>The school counsellor has an office on the 2nd floor. Sessions last up
to 30 minutes (depending on the circumstances), and appointment times can
be varied during the school day. Sessions are always conducted during non-core
periods. The school counsellor can only meet with your child once you have
signed the consent form.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is it confidential?</em></strong>
<br>Whilst sessions are confidential, all parents/carers of primary school
children will be offered an opportunity to meet with their child’s counsellor
during the time they are receiving counselling. This will provide an opportunity
for any concerns to be voiced, any questions to be answered or feedback
to be given. In cases of self-harm or other risk issues, parents and school
leaders will be informed immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>Referrals</em></strong>
<br>Teachers or parents can make a referral to the school counsellor. You
may contact the school counsellor, Ms Anna Wong at 62552502 or email her
at wong_pui_yeang@moe.edu.sg</p>
<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong>
<br>The school aims to develop compassionate leaders who are equipped with
skills and guided by values to bring forth changes and improvement within
self and others.
<br>
</p>
<p>Our key guiding principles in the development of student leaders in KCS
are:
<br>
<br><strong>1. Providing opportunity for all</strong>
<br>All students are provided with avenues to explore their potential for
personal growth and leadership through working with others and developing
cooperation among teams.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Expanding leadership capacity</strong>
<br>All students have the potential to develop and demonstrate leadership
skills over time. Leadership can be developed through learning, guidance,
and role modelling. Through a wide range of leadership training and activities,
student leaders are given the opportunities to practise what they have
learnt and become competent leaders.
<br>
<br><strong>3. Sharing a set of common values and beliefs</strong>
<br>The school shares the vision and the responsibility in Student Leadership
development. The staff values the students’ efforts and facilitates their
leadership training and learning.
<br>
<br><strong>4. Working closely with partners</strong>
<br>Collaboration with stakeholders is an important contributing factor in
the development of the KCS compassionate leader. Here are some snapshots
of the leadership opportunities for KCS Student Leaders:
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Student Leadership<br></u></strong>Kheng Cheng school’s student
leadership is centered upon our four core school values. The school uses
the Student Leadership Challenge model as the approach to its leadership
curriculum. The school hopes that every student leader can learn to be
a concerned citizen and an active contributor and eventually develop as
leaders who can serve with their hearts, heads and hands. Through the learning
and application of leadership skills, values and knowledge, the students
will become more confident, resilient, self-directed and compassionate
leaders of the future. The motto of all student leaders is: Serve to Lead,
Lead to Serve.
<br>
</p>
<p><u>Training for Student Leaders<br></u>The pictorial representation above
illustrates the overview of the training for our student leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Situational Leaders</strong>
<br>Class leaders assume more responsibilities and take on manageable tasks
in the classrooms. Specialized training sessions are conducted for selected
subject monitors for them to carry out their role more effectively in the
classrooms.

<p><strong><u>Workshops / Trainings for Prefects</u></strong><u><br></u>The
school has adopted the Student Leadership Challenge by Barry Posner and
James M. Kouzes and align our training to the approach. We arrange for
a Public Communications workshop for the P4 Prefects and a Design Thinking
Problem-Solving workshop for the P5 Prefects on a yearly basis. Through
the workshops, we hope to build confidence in the Prefects to speak up
and stand up with courage. These useful skills can be applied in their
everyday life.

<p><strong><u>Communication with Prefects</u></strong>
<br>Prefects and parents can refer to the Prefectorial Notice Board in the
canteen for information on duty roster. Carrying out school duties is part
of a Prefect’s responsibilities. Consent forms will be sent via Parents
Gateway prior to meetings or workshops. On days with just-in-time announcements,
teachers from the Student Leadership Committee will disseminate information
to the Prefects. For queries, Prefects are encouraged to approach the teacher-in-charge
of his/her level for clarifications.
