# Approach
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Restorative School Discipine</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they also need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve. Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instill self-discipline and good character in students. In school, we adopt a positive and proactive approach in discipline when we work with our students. 
</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline, the school strives to:
</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>Promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, and prevent challenging behaviours from occurring;</li>
	<li>Address inappropriate behaviour promptly, and correct it before it affects students’ development and well-being;</li>
	<li>Replace inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and restore relationships with others hurt by their actions.</li>
	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Restorative Practices and mutual respect are the foundations for interactions across members of the KCS community, not solely through fear and punishment. Besides educating students to make the right choices, it is important to restore strained relationships between students and the affected parties. The aim of Restorative Practice is to manage conflict and tension by repairing harm and strengthening relationships as a way of building community. It allows students to reflect on their poor choices made and discover ways they can do better. Some restorative questions we go through with the students are:

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Restorative Questions for Recall, Reflection and Response:<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>What happen?</li>
	<li>What was going through your mind at that time?</li>
	<li>Who has been affected by what you did? How?</li>
	<li>What do you think about it now?</li>
	<li>What can you do to fix things up?</li>
	<li>What can I do to help you?</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Disciplinary consequences serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment, and will be meted out fairly, firmly and appropriately. Our school establishes rules and regulations for promoting good behaviour and ensuring a safe and conducive environment for the overall development of students. Parents / Guardians can refer to the Student Handbook for our set of school rules and regulations. The school maintains regular communication between parents and teachers as we believe that strong home-school partnership is essential in developing self-discipline and good character in our students.
