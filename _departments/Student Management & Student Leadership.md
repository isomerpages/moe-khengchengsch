# Approach
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Restorative School Discipine</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they also need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve. Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instill self-discipline and good character in students. In school, we adopt a positive and proactive approach in discipline when we work with our students. 
</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline, the school strives to:
</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>Promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, and prevent challenging behaviours from occurring;</li>
	<li>Address inappropriate behaviour promptly, and correct it before it affects students’ development and well-being;</li>
	<li>Replace inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and restore relationships with others hurt by their actions.</li>
	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Restorative Practices and mutual respect are the foundations for interactions across members of the KCS community, not solely through fear and punishment. Besides educating students to make the right choices, it is important to restore strained relationships between students and the affected parties. The aim of Restorative Practice is to manage conflict and tension by repairing harm and strengthening relationships as a way of building community. It allows students to reflect on their poor choices made and discover ways they can do better. Some restorative questions we go through with the students are:
</span>
	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Restorative Questions for Recall, Reflection and Response:<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>What happen?</li>
	<li>What was going through your mind at that time?</li>
	<li>Who has been affected by what you did? How?</li>
	<li>What do you think about it now?</li>
	<li>What can you do to fix things up?</li>
	<li>What can I do to help you?</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Disciplinary consequences serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment, and will be meted out fairly, firmly and appropriately. Our school establishes rules and regulations for promoting good behaviour and ensuring a safe and conducive environment for the overall development of students. Parents / Guardians can refer to the Student Handbook for our set of school rules and regulations. The school maintains regular communication between parents and teachers as we believe that strong home-school partnership is essential in developing self-discipline and good character in our students.

# Key Programmes
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Discipline Talks</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"> Discipline talks are conducted on a termly basis. Students are reminded of the school rules in a timely manner and are advised to abide by them. Form teachers go through the school rules on the first day of school and through teachable moments in class. 
</span>
	
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Safety Talks</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><u>Road Safety Programme and Reminders</u><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students are advised to practise the Kerb Drill when they cross the roads. Videos are screened to provide visuals for students to better understand how they can keep themselves safe on the oroads. The P5 students will be attending road safety training 
organized by the Traffic Police this year. The objective of the training is to educate the students on good road safety habits in a simulated traffic environment and prepare every student to be conscious of road safety and 
to shape the right behaviour. Parents will be informed of the details nearer to the dates.

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Safety Play Messages</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The school designates play areas for students to use during their recesses and lunch breaks. This is to ensure appropriate and sufficient space for students to play safely. All students are encouraged to leave their classrooms and take a break on level one during these 
breaks. Reminders on safe and responsible play are sent through morning announcements. We encourage students to share playing spaces and be alert to their surroundings. Students should not engage in 
rough play and should not play if he/she is not well. If students notice injury, they are to report to a nearby teacher on duty. Some areas students should not play at are the corridors, at the staircases and in the canteen. Through level meetings with the assistant year heads and year heads, students are also reminded on how to play safely. 

A simple slogan for our students to remember: 

Safety is as simple as ABC. <b>A</b>lways <b>B</b>e <b>C</b>areful!

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Promoting Punctuality</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">School hours start at 7.30 a.m. and we strongly encourage students to come early. Punctuality is a crucial life skill we want to imbue in our students. Parents would be informed of students’ late-coming through daily late-coming slips issued to students. For recalcitrant students, a Parent-Teacher Conference would be arranged for teachers to understand more and share strategies that the student can try out in order to be punctual. Our teachers take the students’ daily attendance, and late-coming will be noted as part of a student’s behavioural record.
