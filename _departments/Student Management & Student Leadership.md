<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Discipline - To adopt a whole school approach for Restorative Discipline.<br> 
Student Leadership – To provide opportunities for student leaders to apply their learned skills.
</span>

## Approach
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Restorative School Discipine</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they also need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve. Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instill self-discipline and good character in students. In school, we adopt a positive and proactive approach in discipline when we work with our students. 
</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline, the school strives to:
</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>Promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care, and prevent challenging behaviours from occurring;</li>
	<li>Address inappropriate behaviour promptly, and correct it before it affects students’ development and well-being;</li>
	<li>Replace inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and restore relationships with others hurt by their actions.</li>
	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Restorative Practices and mutual respect are the foundations for interactions across members of the KCS community, not solely through fear and punishment. Besides educating students to make the right choices, it is important to restore strained relationships between students and the affected parties. The aim of Restorative Practice is to manage conflict and tension by repairing harm and strengthening relationships as a way of building community. It allows students to reflect on their poor choices made and discover ways they can do better. Some restorative questions we go through with the students are:
</span>
	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Restorative Questions for Recall, Reflection and Response:<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
<ul>
	<li>What happen?</li>
	<li>What was going through your mind at that time?</li>
	<li>Who has been affected by what you did? How?</li>
	<li>What do you think about it now?</li>
	<li>What can you do to fix things up?</li>
	<li>What can I do to help you?</li>
</ul>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Disciplinary consequences serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment, and will be meted out fairly, firmly and appropriately. Our school establishes rules and regulations for promoting good behaviour and ensuring a safe and conducive environment for the overall development of students. Parents / Guardians can refer to the Student Handbook for our set of school rules and regulations. The school maintains regular communication between parents and teachers as we believe that strong home-school partnership is essential in developing self-discipline and good character in our students.

# Key Programmes
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Discipline Talks</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"> Discipline talks are conducted on a termly basis. Students are reminded of the school rules in a timely manner and are advised to abide by them. Form teachers go through the school rules on the first day of school and through teachable moments in class. 
</span>
	
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Safety Talks</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><u>Road Safety Programme and Reminders</u><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Students are advised to practise the Kerb Drill when they cross the roads. Videos are screened to provide visuals for students to better understand how they can keep themselves safe on the oroads. The P5 students will be attending road safety training 
organized by the Traffic Police this year. The objective of the training is to educate the students on good road safety habits in a simulated traffic environment and prepare every student to be conscious of road safety and 
to shape the right behaviour. Parents will be informed of the details nearer to the dates.

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Safety Play Messages</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The school designates play areas for students to use during their recesses and lunch breaks. This is to ensure appropriate and sufficient space for students to play safely. All students are encouraged to leave their classrooms and take a break on level one during these 
breaks. Reminders on safe and responsible play are sent through morning announcements. We encourage students to share playing spaces and be alert to their surroundings. Students should not engage in 
rough play and should not play if he/she is not well. If students notice injury, they are to report to a nearby teacher on duty. Some areas students should not play at are the corridors, at the staircases and in the canteen. Through level meetings with the assistant year heads and year heads, students are also reminded on how to play safely. 

A simple slogan for our students to remember: 

Safety is as simple as ABC. <b>A</b>lways <b>B</b>e <b>C</b>areful!

<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Promoting Punctuality</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">School hours start at 7.30 a.m. and we strongly encourage students to come early. Punctuality is a crucial life skill we want to imbue in our students. Parents would be informed of students’ late-coming through daily late-coming slips issued to students. For recalcitrant students, a Parent-Teacher Conference would be arranged for teachers to understand more and share strategies that the student can try out in order to be punctual. Our teachers take the students’ daily attendance, and late-coming will be noted as part of a student’s behavioural record.


<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Counselling</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><i>What is Counselling?</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Counselling provides an opportunity for children to talk, in confidence, about things that are worrying them or affecting their day to day life. What children choose to talk about is completely up to them, but common issues are bullying, parental separation, stress, friendships, change, bereavement, distressing traumatic events and anger.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><i>What does the school counsellor do?</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Counsellors are trained to listen without judging and to help children sort out their thoughts and feelings. Counsellors in primary schools often use creative activities such as drawing, art and writing to help a child express their concerns.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><i>Why have a counsellor in school?</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">When children are experiencing difficulties at home or in school their concentration and the way they behave can be adversely effected. The school counsellor provides counselling to children in a place that is familiar, safe and secure. By providing emotional support and enabling children to ‘off load’ feelings and anxieties counselling can help a child to concentrate more in class, feel better about themselves and build their self-confidence.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><i>Where and when does counselling take place?</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The school counsellor has an office on the 2nd floor. Sessions last up to 30 minutes (depending on the circumstances), and appointment times can be varied during the school day. Sessions are always conducted during non-core periods. The school counsellor can only meet with your child once you have signed the consent form.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><i>Is it confidential?</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Whilst sessions are confidential, all parents/carers of primary school children will be offered an opportunity to meet with their child’s counsellor during the time they are receiving counselling. This will provide an opportunity for any concerns to be voiced, any questions to be answered or feedback to be given. In cases of self-harm or other risk issues, parents and school leaders will be informed immediately.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><i>Referrals</i></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Teachers or parents can make a referral to the school counsellor.
You may contact the school counsellor, Ms Anna Wong at 62552502 or email her at wong_pui_yeang@moe.edu.sg
	
<span style="font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Student Leadership</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The school aims to develop compassionate leaders who are equipped with skills and guided by values to bring forth changes and improvement within self and others.<br>

Our key guiding principles in the development of student leaders in KCS are:<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue"><br><b>1. Providing opportunity for all</b><br></span>All students are provided with avenues to explore their potential for personal growth and leadership through working with others and developing cooperation among teams.<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue"><br><b>2. Expanding leadership capacity</b><br></span>All students have the potential to develop and demonstrate leadership skills over time. Leadership can be developed through learning, guidance, and role modelling. Through a wide range of leadership training and activities, student leaders are given the opportunities to practise what they have learnt and become competent leaders.<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue"><br><b>3. Sharing a set of common values and beliefs</b><br></span>The school shares the vision and the responsibility in Student Leadership development. The staff values the students’ efforts and facilitates their leadership training and learning.<br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue"><br><b>4. Working closely with partners</b><br></span>Collaboration with stakeholders is an important contributing factor in the development of the KCS compassionate leader. Here are some snapshots of the leadership opportunities for KCS Student Leaders:<br>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><u><b>Student Leadership<br></b></u>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Kheng Cheng school’s student leadership is centered upon our four core school values. The school uses the Student Leadership Challenge model as the approach to its leadership curriculum. The school hopes that every student leader can learn to be a concerned citizen and an active contributor and eventually develop as leaders who can serve with their hearts, heads and hands. Through the learning and application of leadership skills, values and knowledge, the students will become more confident, resilient, self-directed and compassionate leaders of the future. The motto of all student leaders is: Serve to Lead, Lead to Serve.<br>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><u>Training for Student Leaders<br></u>
<img style="width:100%" src="/images/Student Leadership/slt.png">
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The pictorial representation above illustrates the overview of the training for our student leaders.</span>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b>Situational Leaders</b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Class leaders assume more responsibilities and take on manageable tasks in the classrooms. Specialized training sessions are conducted for selected subject monitors for them to carry out their role more effectively in the classrooms.<br>
	
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Here are some photos of our Situational Leaders at Training:<br>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><u>Workshops / Trainings for Prefects</u></b><u><br></u>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The school has adopted the Student Leadership Challenge by Barry Posner and James M. Kouzes and align our training to the approach. We arrange for a Public Communications workshop for the P4 Prefects and a Design Thinking Problem-Solving workshop for the P5 Prefects on a yearly basis. Through the workshops, we hope to build confidence in the Prefects to speak up and stand up with courage. These useful skills can be applied in their everyday life.<br>

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black"><b><u>Communication with Prefects</u></b><br>
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Prefects and parents can refer to the Prefectorial Notice Board in the canteen for information on duty roster. Carrying out school duties is part of a Prefect’s responsibilities. Consent forms will be sent via Parents Gateway prior to meetings or workshops. On days with just-in-time announcements, teachers from the Student Leadership Committee will disseminate information to the Prefects. For queries, Prefects are encouraged to approach the teacher-in-charge of his/her level for clarifications. <br>
