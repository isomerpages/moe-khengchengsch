Dear Parents/Guardians, 

  
The Primary 6 Preliminary Oral will be held on 13 and 14 July 2023 for our P6 students. Similar to our annual practice, all Primary 1 to Primary 5 students will carry out home-based learning (HBL) on both of these dates.

Your child’s/ward’s form teachers and subject teachers have assigned relevant homework according to the timetable for that day, through the different HBL platforms. The details of the HBL assignments can be retrieved from the link below. We seek your assistance in ensuring that your child/ward sets aside sufficient time to complete the assigned tasks.

More information and guide for any log in issues can also be found in the site when you click the link.
