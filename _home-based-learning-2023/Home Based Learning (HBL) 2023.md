<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>The Primary 6 PSLE Listening Comprehension will be held on <strong><em>15 September 2024</em></strong>.
Similar to our annual practice, all Primary 1 to Primary 5 students will
carry out home-based learning (HBL) on both of these dates.</p>
<p>Your child’s/ward’s form teachers and subject teachers have assigned relevant
homework according to the timetable for that day, through the different
HBL platforms. The details of the HBL assignments can be retrieved from&nbsp;the
link below. We seek your assistance in ensuring that your child/ward sets
aside sufficient time to complete the assigned tasks.</p>
<p>More information and guide for any log in issues can also be found in
the site when you click the link.</p>
