##### KHENG CHENG SCHOOL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

Alumni is an asset to school as former students help to foster a sense of pride and loyalty for the school. KCS Alumni Association allows alumni members to strengthen their bond with the school and staff and it is also a platform for former students to reconnect and network. In addition, this fosters a sense of belonging and fellowship amongst the former students. We would like to encourage all alumni to be part of the KCS family by coming on-board, participating in the school events and activities. 

Stay connected through our KCS Alumni Facebook which you could learn about the upcoming school events and register to be our alumni volunteers!
