<p>Big Heart Student Care @ KCS aims to provide quality and affordable after-school
care services for students, especially for those who can benefit from a
structured and supportive environment in after-school care, and particularly
where parents/caregivers are both working.</p>
<p>With its vision, Inspiring Minds • Touching Hearts, our school-based student
care centre supports the holistic development of its students through its
partnership with the Ministry of Education and strong support from the
four Self Help Groups, parents, schools and the community. The holistic
programme is designed in collaboration with schools and other organisations
to cater to the development of a student’s socio-emotional, intellectual,
physical, recreational and creative needs, and to reinforce learning for
students who need additional support.</p>
