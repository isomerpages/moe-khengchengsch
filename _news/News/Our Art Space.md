### CNY Angbao Artworks Display with Toa Payoh East CC (2023)

We are pleased to share with you our students’ second collaboration with Toa Payoh East Community Centre (TPY East CC) for this year’s Chinese New Year event. Our Primary 2 to Primary 6 students made a total of 1000 angbao artworks for the volunteers from Toa Payoh East CC to decorate the community spaces at Toa Payoh East Zone 2 for this festive occasion.

The decorations were placed along the covered shelter in front of Block 233 PCF Kindergarten and some were being put up as a showcase during the Chinese New Year party on 28 January to Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Grassroot advisor to Bishan Toa Payoh Grassroots Organizations.

It is extremely heartening to have received numerous compliments from residents who had seen the decorations around the neighbourhood.

This collaboration allowed our students to foster greater community spirit through this cultural/festive event as the decorations herald a new beginning that helped to uplift residents’ spirits and to look forward to a better year ahead after the Covid-19 pandemic. It also provided a platform for our students to feel a deeper connection with their community through their artworks and allow them to showcase their artwork in public.

We look forward to our third year collaboration opportunity together with TPY East CC next year!
