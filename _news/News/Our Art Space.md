# CNY Angbao Artworks Display with Toa Payoh East CC (2023)
<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We are pleased to share with you our students’ second collaboration with Toa Payoh East Community Centre (TPY East CC) for this year’s Chinese New Year event. Our Primary 2 to Primary 6 students made a total of 1000 angbao artworks for the volunteers from Toa Payoh East CC to decorate the community spaces at Toa Payoh East Zone 2 for this festive occasion.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">The decorations were placed along the covered shelter in front of Block 233 PCF Kindergarten and some were being put up as a showcase during the Chinese New Year party on 28 January to Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Grassroot advisor to Bishan Toa Payoh Grassroots Organizations.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">It is extremely heartening to have received numerous compliments from residents who had seen the decorations around the neighbourhood.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">This collaboration allowed our students to foster greater community spirit through this cultural/festive event as the decorations herald a new
beginning that helped to uplift residents’ spirits and to look forward to a better year ahead after the Covid-19 pandemic. It also provided a platform for our students to feel a deeper connection with their community through their artworks and allow them to showcase their artwork in public.

<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">We look forward to our third year collaboration opportunity together with TPY East CC next year!
