<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Museum-based Learning (MBL) has been implemented as one of the core learning experiences in the Primary Art Syllabus. This year, the visit to the museum was conducted on-site at National Gallery Singapore, where all Primary 4 students were engaged as artists and audiences to learn and appreciate local art and heritage as part of their visit experience to one of the local art museums. This MBL experience aims to promote character and citizenship values and dispositions through the school-based art curriculum by making meaningful learning connections between Art and Family Education which are also part of the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) syllabus.
