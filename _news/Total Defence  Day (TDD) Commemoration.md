<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Total Defence Day falls on 15 February each year to mark the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. The theme of this year’s Total Defence Day is ‘Together, We Keep Singapore Strong’. It focusses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives. Kheng Cheng School commemorated Total Defence Day during the morning school assembly on Friday, 10 February. <br><br>Our Cub Scouts, Girls Brigade and Red Cross Links lead the school in the flag-raising ceremony, together with KCS staff from the Uniformed Groups. It was a welcomed sight after three years of SMM put in place. The focus this year was Civil Defence. Through the concert segment, students learnt to be alert, know who to call and where to go during an emergency, such as a fire. This provided them with the knowledge to be effective first responders in the event of an emergency. In this way, they too, can play their part in saving lives. Students also engage in various recess activities run by the uniformed groups and teachers from the NESS Committee on 15 and 17 February. The students truly enjoyed themselves while learning useful skills in the process! </span></span>
