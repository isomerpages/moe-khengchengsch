<p>Racial Harmony Day is celebrated annually by schools to help students
gain a deeper appreciation for racial harmony and social cohesion. At KCS,
we focused on our social fabric, highlighting aspects such as weddings,
clothing, and food. We observed RHD on 19 July 2024.</p>
<p>During the commemoration, we showcased traditional Chinese and Malay wedding
customs. Students had the opportunity to witness the "bersanding" ceremony
and the Chinese tea ceremony. The rhythmic sounds of the "kompang" and
the colorful "bunga manggar" accompanying the groom created a festive wedding
atmosphere for the students. The final part of the commemoration was a
fashion parade, where teachers and school leaders, dressed in vibrant and
glittering ethnic attire, walked the catwalk with their students.</p>
<p>During recess, we held a food discovery event. Students were all smiles
as they explored traditional delicacies and drinks from different cultures.
The prata from Casuarina Curry was the most popular station, with students
in awe as they watched the prata being flipped and tossed in the air. Students
also enjoyed "teh tarik" and Chinese tea, while the Malay station offered
"putri salat" and "epok-epok."</p>
<p>The students' boldness in trying new things was commendable, and their
enthusiasm made the tasting event unforgettable.</p>
