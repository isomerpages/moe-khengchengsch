On the 24th March 2023, our Art & Crafts Club members went on a tour to Dragon Kiln during their CCA session at Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle, Singapore's oldest surviving dragon kiln owned by Tan family since 1965. This learning journey provided opportunity for our members to inculcate good appreciation for art as they were exposed to a learning experience at a professional art venue. They learned about the history, construction method and firing process of the dragon kiln from the industry professionals. They also had fun participating in pottery artmaking activities as they learned how a ceramic pot is crafted by in-house ceramic artist/potters using hand-building technique and electric wheels.
