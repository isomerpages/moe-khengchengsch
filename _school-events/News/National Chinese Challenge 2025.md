<p>We are proud to share that our upper primary Higher Chinese Language students
participated in the <strong>National Chinese Challenge 2025</strong>, an
annual competition jointly organized by <strong>SPH Media</strong> and <strong>Nanyang Girls’ High School</strong>.
Held on 8 March, the event brought together top young Chinese language
learners across the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an exciting achievement, our school has emerged as <strong>one of the top six primary schools to qualify for the Finals</strong>—a
first in our school’s history! Our team will compete against five other
primary schools in the Grand Finals on <strong>26 April at One Punggol</strong>,
starting at <strong>9:30 a.m.</strong> The event is open to the public, and
we welcome everyone to support our students live!</p>

<p><strong>Teachers’ Reflections</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mdm Zhang Li, Teacher-in-Charge:</strong>
<br><em>"When we received the news, both our teachers and students were overjoyed! Rather than intensive crash courses, we have always focused on fostering a deep understanding of the language and its real-world applications. This achievement is a testament to our students’ proficiency and their dedication to mastering Chinese."</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr Lim Ming En, Subject Head (Chinese &amp; HAL):</strong>
<br><em>"Reaching the Finals is a tremendous milestone for our school. In the coming weeks, we will conduct simulation training to help our students refine their skills under competition conditions. With structured practice and determination, we are confident they will put on a stellar performance in the Finals."</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We congratulate our students and wish them the best in the upcoming competition!
Stay tuned for updates on their journey.</p>
