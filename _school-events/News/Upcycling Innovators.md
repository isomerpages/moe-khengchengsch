Through our school’s Art & Crafts Club and Environmental Science Club partnership with the Art & Crafts Club members of Xinmin Secondary School, our members learned from their seniors on how they could be active innovators of upcycled products with the use of their craftwork making skills. They enjoyed the authentic learning experience as they forged deeper connections with the student facilitators of Xinmin Secondary School during their interaction. They look forward to raising eco-friendly awareness by sharing the functional tricycle planters that they had created as tokens for the visitors of our school’s Open House.
