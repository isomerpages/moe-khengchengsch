<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">After a 3 year hiatus due to Covid, the 90th GB Company was finally able to send a team to take part in the National Drill Competition. 
Through the hard work, dedication and perseverance of these girls, **we were awarded a Silver Award!** 
We are really proud of how far they have come in a short span of three months as they had only started 
learning the basic foot drills at the beginning of this year.
