This year, the KCS Music Department received a total of 154 IMC 2023 submissions from the students of KCS. The IMC would not have been made possible without the many hours of hard work and passion by the students, and the support of their parents. This year, we have included the Digital Concert Hall to showcase the performances by the finalists of the IMC 2023.  Through this, we hope that everyone in the KCS community (and beyond!) would be able to enjoy each others' performances and learn from the strengths of each performance. Enjoy!<br>
