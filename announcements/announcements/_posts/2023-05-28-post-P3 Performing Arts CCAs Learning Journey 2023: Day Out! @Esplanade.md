<span style="font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">
On the 24th May 2023, our P3 performing arts CCAs members embarked on a “Day Out! @Esplanade” learning journey. It was a day filled with excitement, discovery, and an immersive experience into the captivating world of performing arts. From the grand concert halls to an extraordinary street dance performance at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre. The dance floor came alive with our energy and enthusiasm as we grooved to the beats, channeling our inner dancers! Our exploration of musical cultures continued with explore traditional Chinese percussion instruments, opening our eyes to the richness and diversity of musical traditions. Through hands-on exploration and guidance, we learned to create music with these instruments. The rhythmic patterns we created resonated with our senses and left us with a newfound appreciation for the power of percussive expressions. One of the highlights of the day was the angklung ensemble, where we discovered the value of teamwork and rhythm. Through collaborative efforts, we formed an ensemble and experienced firsthand the power of synchronization as we played the traditional Indonesian musical instrument, the angklung. The rhythmic beats filled the air, and our hearts swelled with a sense of unity and accomplishment. Throughout the day, we were fortunate to explore the different performing spaces within the Esplanade, further enhancing our understanding of the unique features and ambience of each venue. The grandeur of the concert halls and the intimate atmosphere of the theaters left an indelible impression on us, deepening our admiration for the art of performance and the dedication of the artists who grace these stages. <br>
