**Chinese New Year**

It has been a long three years since Kheng Cheng teachers and students sit together to enjoy the Lunar New Year in the hall! On the 20 January, the hall was first filled with melodious and uplifting musical medley by the Chinese Orchestra team. The lyrical or contemporary dance yet peppered with Chinese essence that caught all the attention. Angklung, the traditional Malay instruments, added to the harmonious accent of Kheng Cheng ambience. It was ecstatic to see the overwhelming response from the audience during the games session. Well-wishes video from the teachers added an auspicious atmosphere. The climax of celebration was the Lion Dance and Big Head Wawa dancing which captivated the students and elicited rapturous cheers. Happy New Year to us all!
